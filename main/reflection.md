Setting up the Django environment for this assignment turned out to be both a challenge and a learning experience. One of the first problems I ran into was making sure the versions of Python and Django were compatible. I also needed to create and activate a virtual environment before installing Django. At first, I forgot to activate the virtual environment, which caused a lot of confusion because Django commands kept failing. Once I remembered to activate it, things began to work smoothly.

Another issue I faced was related to loading templates. Django threw a TemplateDoesNotExist error for home.html, and I had to figure out why. After some troubleshooting, I realized my templates were placed in the wrong folder. I also needed to confirm that 'APP_DIRS': True was enabled in the settings. Adjusting the folder structure and updating the settings finally fixed the problem, and the templates started rendering correctly.

Lastly, pushing my project to GitHub caused a few headaches. Git required me to configure my username, email, and branch before I could push successfully. In the end, this whole process taught me the value of carefully reading error messages and problem-solving step by step.
